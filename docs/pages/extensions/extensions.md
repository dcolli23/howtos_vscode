# Extensions
{:.no_toc}

These pages describe the extensions that I like to download to make developing in VS Code even easier.

* TOC
{:toc}

## Git Extensions

- Git History
- Git Graph
- GitLens
- Git Blame

## Python Extensions

These extensions make it a breeze to develop with Python

- Python
  - Haven't put much thought into this one. I think it's the default recommended one.
- Python Docstring Generator
  - Really helpful automatic docstring generator.

## C/C++ Extensions

- C/C++
- Doxygen Documentation Generator
- CMake
  - Provides language support for CMake.

## Documentation/Text Editing Extensions

These extensions make it easier to work with writing documentation and editing texts in general.

### Markdown Extensions

Markdown-specific extensions. Something that I use a lot since I journal exclusively in markdown.

- Markdown Preview Enhanced
  - A slightly better previewer than the built-in VS Code markdown previewer.
- Markdown All in One
  - Lots of editing automation like automatically updated table of contents, checklists, etc.

### PDF Extensions

These extensions pertain to working with PDFs.

- VSCode-pdf
  - Lets you display PDF files in VS Code.

### Code Architecture

- PlantUML
  - Awesome tool for architecting/planning out code. VERY useful. Something that rapidly accelerated my development time.

### Draw.io Integration

**Awesome** draw.io integration directly in VS Code. Works great and is excellent for producing quick diagrams.

## Remote Development

These extensions pertain to developing on machines other than your local one.

- Remote - SSH
  - Great so that you can develop remotely in VS Code instead of having to configure your Vim installation just how you like it.

## Miscellaneous Extensions

- vscode-icons
  - Adds small icons next to directories/files in file explorer menu. Useful for quickly identifying file type instead of reading file extensions.
- ROS
  - Apparently this is very useful. I haven't had a chance to extensively explore the features offered in this extension.
